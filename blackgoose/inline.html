<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p> This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <b>sous vide</b>. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food <i>(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic)</i> into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book,<cite> Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching</q>.</p>
<p> Next month, we will be serving <dfn> Sous Vide</dfn> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.<em> <b>To reserve a seat at the chef table</b>, contact us before November 30</em>.</p>

<p><em><b>Warning</em></b>:<small>Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues</small>.</p>
